## notes

### todo
* re-enable ASAR
  * Is currently disabled cause otherwise in packaged mode the code does not find the youtube-dl executable
  * Current output: asar using is disabled â€” it is strongly not recommended  solution=enable asar and use asarUnpack to unpack files that must be externally available

### ideas / brainstorming
* badge support?
* ffmpeg: make pull request to https://github.com/pietrop/ffmpeg-static-electron to update from ffmpeg 3.x to 4.x
  * 20191210 - Created pull request for ffmpeg 4.2.1
* youtube-dl
  * Offers selfupdate using -U. Is that an option for node-youtube-dl as well? I assume not
  * Parameters/Flags
    * --write-all-thumbnails ?
    * --geo-bypass to Bypass geographic restriction via faking X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. No idea if that might be helpful to add or not
* ffmpeg-static-electron: currently my Windows build contains the bin files for linux and mac as well. Why? Assuming cause: electron-packager doesnt know it better.

### urls
* youtube-dl repository: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl
* node-youtube-dl repo: https://github.com/przemyslawpluta/node-youtube-dl
